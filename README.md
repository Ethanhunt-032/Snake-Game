# Snake-Game
I have built a snake Game of 2 versions upgraded using my DSA Skills in C++

### Version 1:
This version is a basic one and the snake can be killed only by clicking "X" ;
snake cant be killed by crossing over it or toucjing boundaries!

### Version 2:
This version is a better and upgraded one with adjustable frame rate speed and
crossing its tail kills and touching boundary kills and the snake length is modifies
